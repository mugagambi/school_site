  <p>Hogwarts school was initially started in 1902 around the present Nairobi Railways club as a
     European school to serve the families of the I.B.E.A
      Company and later the white settler community.
       Out of the foresight and wisdom of the late Lord Delamere
        in proposing the building a senior Boys school (now Nairobi Primary),
         and the support of the then governor, Sir Edward Grigg, the railway reserve
          grounds near Kabete home for the school.

  <p>In 1928, Sir Herbart Baker was commissioned to plan a school similar
     to Winchester school, attended by both Lord Delamere and the
      then Governor-Kenya colony, in Winchester, an old town in
      Southern England dating from about 516AD, after the Romans
      left England. It was a major administrative and silver minting
       center, and hence, a Saxon Capital of England form 1066AD.

       The school named after this town was originally
        founded to educate boy choristers. It was later
         re-founded in 1541 after King Henry VIII had destroyed
         the monasteries. Today the school is one
         of the leading independent schools in England.
          Captain Nicholson (recently retired form the loyal
           navy college, Dartmouth) designed the uniform and
            prepared school rules and regulations to match the
             discipline of the navy tradition. In the meantime Mrs.
              Nicholson planned the gardens.
